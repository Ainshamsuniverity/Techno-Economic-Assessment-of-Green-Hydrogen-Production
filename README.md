# Project details
We start to understand the model that was uploaded on the MATLAB site and analyze how it works (the number of hours the electrolyzer works, the storage when discharged and charged, and how much power the solar system produces).
Then, we started to search and increase our knowledge about solar and green hydrogen production. We made plain storming to improve the model to decrease the cost of hydrogen and the power of grid use, and we made a case study as an Prototype.
So, we make a techno-economic assessment to choose the best location that has a large irradiance, in addition to a low grid cost site from the results (Putre, Chile) was the best location, and the suitable capacity for the electrolyzer was at 150KW.
Also, we make calculations to increase the capacity of storage and increase the solar power to decrease the power usage of the grid network. By importing the capital and operation costs as signals in the model.

# How to run section
By the beginning, make sure that you have downloaded all the files, including the pictures and Excel file, and then open the Matlab code and click run to run all the code, so MATLAB script will automate the loading of data, run the simulation at different locations, and calculate economic cost.the model will be opened and run for 242 Location, and at the end of the run, you will get the final minimum and maximum cost of H2 and the final minimum and maximum total cost and at which country.

# Demo
Add a video or animated gif/picture to showcase the code in operation.
